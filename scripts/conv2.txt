Hi there. Why aren't you RANDOM_VERB?
Hello. Have you tried RANDOM_THING yet?
Are you going to the party on RANDOM_WEEKDAYS?
No, but I was just about to.
Don't. It's terrible.
Oh. Okay.
I was thinking about it. Are you?
So, how are you knowing RANDOM_NAME?
Oh, RANDOM_NAME and I go way back. We studied RANDOM_STUDY together.
RANDOM_STUDY. Hmm. I heard on the radio RANDOM_WEEKDAY that all of you nurses are on strike. Are they not paying you enough?
Yeah, I heard it's going to be a lot of fun.
Actually it's about working conditions.
I see. So, have you had a chance to take a RANDOM_ACTION?
Really? Well, what time does it start?
No, not yet. How about you?
No, I need to lose some weight before I put on a bathing suit. But you have a great figure.
Uh, thanks. Well, I better go and RANDOM_VERBK. There are a few people I haven't said hello to yet.
It starts at RANDOM_TIME pm, and I really think you should go.
Wait! Did you hear that the RANDOM_NAMEK is coming to town?
Ya. I heard that on the news RANDOM_WEEKDAYK. I bet it'll be really tough to get to see him.
I know. But I'm not RANDOM_RELIGION anyway. Are you?
Well, who else is going to be there?
Yes, I am actually. Well, it looks the sun is finally coming out. I think I'll go take that RANDOM_THINGK.
Everybody from school.
You better hurry. I hear they are asking for thunderstorms this RANDOM_DAYTIME.
How do you know it's going to be so fun?
This party is going to have a DJ, food, and drinks. And it is at RANDOM_LOCATION
Wow, that does sound like it's going to be fun.
So am I going to see you at the party?
Yeah, I will be there. Keep negative comments out of your small talk. You don't know if the person you are talking about is a close friend of the person you are talking to. During small talk it is not appropriate to discuss salaries.
