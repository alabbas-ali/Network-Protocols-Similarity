Hi there. Why aren't you RANDOM_VERB?
Hello. Have you tried RANDOM_THING yet?
No, but I was just about to.
Don't. It's terrible.
Oh. Okay.
So, how are you knowing RANDOM_NAME?
Oh, RANDOM_NAME and I go way back. We studied RANDOM_STUDY together.
RANDOM_STUDY. Hmm. I heard on the radio RANDOM_WEEKDAY that all of you nurses are on strike. Are they not paying you enough?
Actually it's about working conditions.
I see. So, have you had a chance to take a RANDOM_ACTION?
No, not yet. How about you?
No, I need to lose some weight before I put on a bathing suit. But you have a great figure.
Uh, thanks. Well, I better go and RANDOM_VERB2. There are a few people I haven't said hello to yet.
Wait! Did you hear that the RANDOM_NAME2 is coming to town?
Ya. I heard that on the news RANDOM_WEEKDAY2. I bet it'll be really tough to get to see him.
I know. But I'm not RANDOM_RELIGION anyway. Are you?
Yes, I am actually. Well, it looks the sun is finally coming out. I think I'll go take that RANDOM_THING2.
You better hurry. I hear they are asking for thunderstorms this RANDOM_DAYTIME.
