# Network-Protocols-Similarity

This is research project under Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences
https://www.frankfurt-university.de/


This project aims to Text Similarity Metrics, applying them in HEX representation of 
Network protocols and do a statistical test to find out which Metrics is best applicable 
to which protocol. do a statistical test to prove or reject the possibility of 
distinguishing between protocols be payload comparing.


# Description

This research project contains the following folders :

- documents: some project documentation, and experiment explanation.
- resources: PDFs resource and related works.
- scripts: Experiment automate script/Results, SIP Simulation script, FTP payload extraction script
			SIP server Simulation script .. Etc
- SimilarityMetrics: Java Implementation of different Text Similarity Metrics.
- PcapReader: Java Project to extract different protocols payload content and save them in sperate files
- PacketComparing: Java project to extract the similarity metrics result of different protocols comparison and save results in excel file 
- PacketClustring: Java Project (still not fully implemented), aims to do classification based on protocol payload similarity and feature selection
